# POLAr

A package for R language with some functions to read data from Polar watch files.

It can parse `.pdd` exercise files and user the user `.ppd` file.

Also can aggregate some data by time span. Probably data.table is better for that, I do not need to use these functions anymore.

It was written many years ago and my R coding style was very poor and ineffective.
Although, I still use it as intended, as I keep all my data and in that old format.

## Request

It will be nice if it could be expanded to be able to read heart rate files `.hrm`
Some work have been done already.

Still I haven't found an existing way to combine Polar data (`.gpx` and `.hrm`) to other formats like `.tcx`.
If you have any suggestion I would love to hear it.
